I created a web app with using React. It’s a dynamic map where user can get spatial data from OpenStreetMap(OSM) and render it on map. I wrote a query that fetch the data from OSM database according to map’s bounding box coordinates and this data involves point of interest such as banks, place of worship etc. and their corresponding administrative boundaries like Kadikoy for Istanbul. After fetching data user can create a table with region’s point of interest data. I used OpenLayers for handling spatial data.
